# Gitpod Browser extension

[![Setup Automated](https://img.shields.io/badge/setup-automated-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/browser-extension)

This is the browser extension for Gitpod. It supports Chrome (see [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki/)), Firefox (see [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/)) and Edge (see [how to install Chrome extensions](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4538971/microsoft-edge-add-or-remove-extensions)), and adds a **Gitpod** button to the configured GitLab, GitHub and Bitbucket installations (defaults to `gitlab.com`, `github.com`, `bitbucket.org`, and `gitlab.cn`) which immediately creates a Gitpod workspace for the current Git context:

### Issues

We are currently tracking all issues related to the browser extension in the [`gitpod-io/gitpod`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod) repository.
You can use the [`component: browser-extension`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+extension+label%3A%22component%3A+browser-extension%22) label to search for relevant issues including feature proposals and bug reports.

### Development

To make changes and test them using Gitpod itself:

- add test cases to the [unit test](https://github.com/gitpod-io/browser-extension/blob/se/plasmo/test/src/button-contributions.spec.ts#L39)
- try out changes like this:
  1. run `pnpm build`
  1. run `pnpm watch-prod` and download the built binary for your system (local machine)
  1. run the binary anywhere on your local machine to sync the extension folder locally.
  1. open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
  1. enable `Developer mode` (top right)
  1. click `Load unpacked` (top left) and select the folder you just downloaded
  1. now you can test your changes
  1. repeat step 1 and 2 and [reload the extension](chrome://extensions/) whenever you want to test new changes

#### Build

The build happens automatically when you start a workspace but if you want to build explicitly, use these commands:

```
pnpm install
pnpm build --target=chrome-mv3 # or --target=firefox-mv2
pnpm package --target=chrome-mv3 # or --target=firefox-mv2
```

### Testing

You can test the extension without publishing to the store. Before uploading the bundle to the browser, make sure to [build](#build) the code, then follow these steps:

For Chrome:

1. Open Chrome
2. Click Settings -> Extensions -> Load unpacked
3. Select the `chrome-mv3-prod` folder inside of `build/`

For Firefox

1. Open Firefox
1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
1. Click Load Temporary Add-on -> Select the `firefox-mv2-prod.zip` file. Please note, that some features (like extension settings) will not work.

## Release

We currently publish the extension for **Chrome** and **Firefox**.

To release a new version, follow these steps:

1. Bump up the version value inside `manifest.json`
1. Push your changes to `master`
1. Create a tag `vX.Y.Z`
1. Compose a list of changes using the list of commits that were pushed since last version
1. [Create a new release](https://github.com/gitpod-io/browser-extension/releases/new), listing changes:
