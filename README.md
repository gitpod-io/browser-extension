# Gitpod Browser extension
[![Setup Automated](https://img.shields.io/badge/setup-automated-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/browser-extension)

This is the browser extension for Gitpod. It supports Chrome (see [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki/)), Firefox (see [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/)) and Edge (see [how to install Chrome extensions](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4538971/microsoft-edge-add-or-remove-extensions)), and adds a **Gitpod** button to the configured GitLab, GitHub and Bitbucket installations (defaults to `gitlab.com`, `github.com`, `bitbucket.org`, and `gitlab.cn`) which immediately creates a Gitpod workspace for the current Git context:

Contributions to this project are welcome!

### Issues

We are currently tracking all issues related to the browser extension in the [`gitpod-io/gitpod`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod) repository.
You can use the [`component: browser-extension`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+extension+label%3A%22component%3A+browser-extension%22) label to search for relevant issues including feature proposals and bug reports.

### Development

To make changes and test them, the easiest way is using Gitpod itself. The `.gitpod.yml` configuration for this project installs Google Chrome and runs a VNC server to allow users to see the Desktop of the Docker container. When a workspace starts, Google Chrome is started with the Gitpod extension automatically built from source and pre-installed, therefore you can preview your changes in the ephemeral Chrome browser. ü§Ø

#### Build

The build happens automatically when you start a workspace but if you want to build explicitly, use these commands:

```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn package
```

### Testing

You can test the extension without publishing to the store. Before uploading the bundle to the browser, make sure to [build](#build) the code, then follow these steps:

For Chrome:

1. Rename `gitpod.xpi` to `gitpod.zip`
1. Unzip `gitpod.zip`
1. Open Chrome
1. Click Settings -> Extensions -> Load unpacked
1. Select the unzipped folder

For Firefox

1. Open Firefox
1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
1. Click Load Temporary Add-on -> Select the `gitpod.xpi` file

For Safari (Experimental üß™)

1. Open `Gitpod/Gitpod.xcodeproj`
1. Run the project with `cmd` + `r`. ‚ö†Ô∏è _Safari must have [**Allow Unsigned Extensions**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions/building_a_safari_app_extension) enabled._

## Release

We currently publish the extension for **Chrome** and **Firefox**.

To release a new version, follow these steps:

1. Bump up the version value inside `manifest.json`
1. Push your changes to `master`
1. Create a tag `vX.Y.Z`
1. Compose a list of changes using the list of commits that were pushed since last version
1. [Create a new release](https://github.com/gitpod-io/browser-extension/releases/new), listing changes:

    ```yaml

### Safari

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è A machine running macOS and [Xcode 12+](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed is required!

First, run the following to install dependencies and build the web extension:

```
yarn install && yarn build && yarn package
```

Then run the `build:safari` command to build the Safari extension around the web extension:

```
yarn build:safari
```

![Confirm Safari](./docs/safari-confirm.png "Confirm Safari")

Hit `enter` when presented with this screen.

`Xcode` will open the `Gitpod.xcodeproj` automatically if it's installed.
